  Thanks to the magic of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API">IndexDB</a> this app runs entirely in the browser ( file uploads are not to any backend , the files are are read only into local storage and indexdb).  There are build targets for native binaries for windows, macos, and linux which I was hoping to monetize but now my hopes and dreams are dead and I hate you for it
