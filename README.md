# Stjou - An Open Source Stock Trading Journal

# <a href="https://stjou.com">stjou.com</a> - build 1.36

<h4>An open source trading journal you can run locally, <a href="https://stjou.com">or use on the web</a>.</h4>


<h5>
StJou is a free stock trading journal that runs entirely in the browser and has no backend server component.

This is accomplished by using LocalStorage to store the entire state of the running application.  LocalStorage only has 5MB of storage, so the import data itself is kept in IndexeDB , a database that ships with Chrome and Webkit.
